# Contribution rules

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! Please follow these rules for contributing:

- Make constructive and meaningful changes.
- Modifications shall be done to ~/bot.js, **NOT** ~/Discord-Spotify.js!
- Follow the JavaScript ES6 syntax.
- Test that your code works, both in Discord and by running `npm test`.
- If the above point passes, run `npm run build` to add a new built file before committing to your fork and PRing.
