# Discord-Spotify

Simple Node.js bot for getting your current playing song in Spotify and mirroring it to your Discord status.

## How it works

The bot is mainly intended for use on your own user account. When started, the bot will log the current playing track in the background.

It will set your Discord status to the current track with the format `â™« ${artistName} - ${trackName}`. When the track ends and changes, the bot will automatically update your playing status without any user input. Fire and forget, right?

Due to how Discord functions, the status updates will not show in your client. You should rely on this working, if in doubt, ask a friend as they'll see it.

## Example

Outlook in the members sidebar:

And in your public profile:

## Commands

These commands cannot be executed by anyone else than the account the bot runs on.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| clearstatus | Debug tool to wipe your status if it is stuck. |
| exit | Gracefully terminate the process and wipe the status on exit. |

## Install

Clone the repository into a folder of your choice. `npm install` will install local dependencies. If you want to use legacy Node, you don't need to do anything further for the installation part.

In case you want to, dependencies needed as global can be installed by running the global install script for your OS from the `scripts` folder. You can run the bot without these, however having them global especially if you want to contribute is a good idea.

## Configuration
Open `config.example.json` and replace the placeholder in the `token` field with your user account token (Or bot token, if you're doing this with some special purpose). Save the file as `config.json`. The token in either case is sensitive and should hence not be exposed in any way.

### User Account
If you want to use your own user account, you need to have 2-factor authentication enabled on your account. Then use the Electron inspector inside the Discord client to find the token from the local storage. The reason I'm being vague here is that if you know how to do what I just described, you understand the risks of it as well.

### Bot Account

If you want to use a bot account, create a bot account in the Discord Developers panel and get the token from there. If you don't know how to do that, check this guide: [http://discordguide.us/#/development/bot-accounts](http://discordguide.us/#/development/embot-accountsem)

## Running

**Make sure Spotify is open and logged in before starting!**

Open a command window in the bot's folder and run `npm start`. This will start the bot with regular Node.js. If you have installed the global deps, you can use `npm run start-es6`.

When you want to exit, it's advised to type `>exit` in any channel where it is discreet to do so. This will make the bot clear your status before exiting and avoid you having the same status message stuck.

**NOTE**: `npm run start-dev` is not intended for you, the end user. Unless you know what this does, don't use it.
